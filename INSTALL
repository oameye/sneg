Quick installation
==================

sneg is essentially a Mathematica script that simply needs to be loaded in
your Mathematica session before you start to perform the calculations. No
compilation or even installation is really required. It is, however,
recommended that you copy sneg files in the standard location where other
Mathematica packages reside. You can determine the correct location by
typing $UserBaseDirectory in a Mathematica sesstion and then appending
Applications/sneg/ to that base path. On Linux and Unix like systems this is
typically

/home/[username]/.Mathematica/Applications/sneg/

or a direcry of similar name (this depends on the version of Mathematica
used). You can then load sneg using <<sneg`sneg` in your Mathematica
session. In addition, you can copy the directory tree Documentation/
in the sample place, i.e. to

/home/[username]/.Mathematica/Applications/sneg/Documentation/

On Windows systems the corresponding directories might be

C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Mathematica\Applications\sneg
C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Mathematica\Applications\sneg\Documentation

while on Mac OS-X they could be

/Users/[username]/Library/Mathematica/Applications/sneg/
/Users/[username]/Library/Mathematica/Applications/sneg/Documentation/

It is also possible to perform a global installation, so that sneg is
accessible to all users of the computer. The suitable global installation
directories can be determined by typing $BaseDirectory in a Mathematica
session and again appending Applications/sneg/. On Windows that would
be

C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Mathematica\Applications\sneg\
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Mathematica\Applications\sneg\Documentation\

and on Linux and Unix

/usr/share/Mathematica/Applications/sneg/
/usr/share/Mathematica/Applications/sneg/Documentation/

Note: After copying Documentation notebooks to the installation directory,
you should start "Rebuild help index" in Help menu in Mathematica, and the
sneg help pages should then appear in Help Browser in Add-ons & Links / sneg
documentation section). 

Eventually, in later versions "make install" will perform the necessary
steps automatically. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to detect in a
robust and portable way what that suitable target location is, so "make
install" currently does not do anything useful.


Note 2 (2008): I have mostly developped and tested sneg using
Mathematica 5.* series. The package works with Mathematica 6, but has
undergone much less testing up to now. In particular, the
documentation has not been updated to integrate better in Mathematica
6's new help system.

Note 3 (2011): sneg has now been tested using Mathematica versions 6,
7, and 8. In Mathematica 8, the Documentation can be located in
the Installed Add-ons section of the integrated Help system.
