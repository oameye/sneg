A new version of the Mathematica package SNEG for performing
calculations using the operators of the second quantization formalism
of quantum mechanics has been released. In the past, SNEG has been
applied to perform exact diagonalizations on Hubbard clusters,
calculations of commutators of complex expressions, perturbation
theory and high-temperature expansions to higher orders, numerical
renormalization group (NRG) calculations, etc. This version adds the
following new functionality:

- support for bosonic operators,
- support for real (Majorana) fermionic operators,
- support for anti-commuting Grassman variables, Berezin integration,
  and fermionic coherent states,
- automatic simplifications of expressions with exponential functions of
  operators using Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff and Mendas-Milutinovic formulas,
- improved automatic canonical ordering of fermionic operators in
  the case of Fermi sea vacuum,
- improved handling of symbolic sums and automatic renaming of dummy indexes
  when name conflicts appear,
- built-in support for pretty printing of operator expressions, obviating
  the need to use the Notation package,
- code for rewriting creation operator expressions in terms of higher-level
  functions, such as number, hopping, spin, and electron-electron repulsion
  terms,
- various performance improvements (for example, the generation of
  basis states with well-defined charge and spin quantum numbers is much
  faster).

Furthermore, the documentation has been significantly improved and is
now browsable in the Mathematica help system. The package is freely
(GPL license) available from
